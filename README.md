Original author: [Jason Grier](https://github.com/jasongrier).

This repo was created from [Manuel Klettke](https://github.com/ManuKle)'s boilerplate for Electron + Redux + Typescript, 
which was in turn based on v0.13.2 of [electron-react-boilerplate](https://github.com/chentsulin/electron-react-boilerplate).

For further dev / build information please refer to the [original repo](https://github.com/chentsulin/electron-react-boilerplate).
